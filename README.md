# Grid
A completely unbalanced 3d multiplayer strategy game!

## How to play
Fire up the server and connect the clients!
/.gridserver
./grid

Each player uses their energy to "charge" some tiles and convert them into their property.
When all the tiles are owned by one player, that player wins (not implemented yet..)
